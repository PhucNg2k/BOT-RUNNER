basic design:  check
implement platform: doing
implement Runner + Docker



1. Separation of Concerns
Runner: Orchestrates the lifecycle and loop, but doesn’t care about trading details.
Worker: Knows how to run a bot on a platform, encapsulating the logic of “get data → get signal → act.”
Bot: Only knows how to generate a signal.
Platform: Only knows how to interact with the exchange.
